            "question": "What are the SDGs and why are they important for member states according to the UN's vision of sustainable development?",
            "answer": "The SDGs, or Sustainable Development Goals, are a set of 17 goals designed by the United Nations to promote economic growth, social progress, and environmental sustainability. Although not legally binding, their fulfillment requires a significant departure from current socio-environmental-economic systems. Experts have urged member countries to create transition pathways containing fundamental changes due to the lack of progress on these goals. (Source: DOI: 10.5086-11 145)"

            "question": "How do political efforts contribute to accelerating sustainability transition and how do they interact with technology, the national context, and pressures from the regional/global level?",
            "answer": "Political efforts play a crucial role in advancing sustainability transition, yet their impact is not isolated as they interconnect with technological advancements, the unique circumstances of each country, and external influences from the regional and global levels. For instance, political will can drive policy changes that incentivize the adoption of green technologies, while also addressing social and economic challenges that may hinder the transition. However, the effectiveness of these efforts can be influenced by factors such as the availability and affordability of technology, the political stability and institutional capacity of a country, and the influence of international actors. The ongoing climate crisis adds an urgent dimension to this dynamic, casting doubt on the sufficiency of techno-solutionism and capitalist systems in securing sustainable development. Thus, political efforts must be seen as integral components of a multifaceted approach to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), requiring careful consideration of the complex interactions between politics, technology, and the broader socio-economic context."

            "question": "How have political actors responded to technological changes and their impact on sustainable development, and what are some suggested models for achieving sustainable development?",
            "answer": "Political actors respond to technological changes by promoting or reacting to new opportunities or threats. They seek to facilitate sustainability transitions through changes in various interrelated technologies, which can provide technical solutions to negative environmental effects of economic growth. The health crisis caused by COVID-19 and the War in Ukraine have caused performance problems on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in many countries. Different transition models have been proposed to achieve sustainable development, including those focused on technology and innovation, systemic change, and policy and governance. For instance, the Technology-Innovation-Policy (TIP) model emphasizes the role of technology and innovation in driving sustainable development, while the Systemic Change model focuses on transforming entire systems towards sustainability. The Policy and Governance model prioritizes policies and governance structures to support sustainable development."

            "answer": "The SDGs encompass goals that can be partly contradictory, making it challenging for green technologies and efforts to fully address these issues. Furthermore, transitional changes brought about by disruptive technologies and policies result in both winners who benefit from new structures and losers whose unsustainable practices are phased out. As a result, various actors are actively engaging in debates surrounding the need for continuity, adaptation, and transitional change to effectively meet the SDGs while mitigating negative impacts on those affected.

            "answer": "The framework proposed in the study explains how top performance on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can be achieved without undergoing transitional change. It goes beyond examining policy outputs and instead focuses on sustainability outcomes and their implications for transition pathways. Specifically, it considers whether these outcomes lead to path-dependency, lock-in, or disruptive shifts in sustainability trajectories. This approach offers a more nuanced understanding of the political factors shaping sustainability transitions. Additionally, the study contributes to scholarship on this topic by demonstrating that high levels of sustainability performance do not necessarily require significant transformative changes. Instead, incremental improvements and adaptations within existing systems may also yield positive outcomes. Overall, the framework provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between politics and sustainability transitions, and highlights the importance of considering both policy outputs and sustainability outcomes when analyzing this relationship."

These strategies include using their economic and political power to lobby against policies that would negatively impact their industries, engaging in public relations campaigns to discredit alternative energy sources, and collaborating with other powerful actors to maintain the status quo. For example, they have lobbied against carbon pricing policies and renewable energy subsidies, and have argued that these policies would harm consumers and the economy. They have also attempted to discredit renewable energy sources through negative advertising campaigns and by downplaying the environmental benefits of renewable energy. Additionally, they have collaborated with other powerful actors, such as governments and industry associations, to maintain their positions of power and influence in the energy sector. Overall, these incumbent actors have used a range of tactics to resist transitions to new low-carbon systems and maintain their dominance in the energy sector."

            "answer": "Rippekaufer (2011) argues that it's essential to focus on the processes through which actors develop new policy ideas and the degree to which these ideas are influenced by both formal rules (laws, regulations, and standards) and informal rules (norms, habits, and customs). This perspective builds upon earlier work by Rippekaufer (2008). Therefore, understanding the interplay of ideas, institutions, and interests requires examining how these factors shape each other during the policy-making process.

            "question": "How does a new discourse contribute to radical policy change and why is it path-dependent?",
            "answer": "A new discourse can lead to radical policy change by transforming existing interests and challenging institutional commitments (Fischer, 2011, p. 1129). This process is path-dependent because the success of the new discourse relies on its ability to align with and reshape existing institutional structures rather than disrupt them entirely. In other words, the new discourse must find a mutually supportive relationship with existing institutions in order for meaningful change to occur. (Fischer, 2011) explains that this alignment allows for the integration of new ideas into existing frameworks, ultimately leading to policy transformation. Conversely, if the new discourse fails to establish such a relationship, it may not gain enough traction to bring about significant change. Therefore, the path-dependency of policy change arises from the interplay between new discourses and existing institutions."

For instance, countries with strong market-liberal ideologies, like the United Kingdom, tend to rely on market-based instruments, whereas those with social democratic values and greater collective and coordinative capacities enable a more active role for government actors in setting and achieving sustainability goals. These differences arise from the path-dependent qualities of institutions, which vary across countries and regions, leading to distinct transition pathways.

            "answer": "The approaches to climate change policies differ between countries based on their underlying values and institutional structures. Market-liberal countries, such as the United Kingdom, have a narrower range of acceptable policy options due to their strong commitment to free markets and limited government intervention. In contrast, countries with social democratic values and greater collective and coordinative capacities, like some European nations, allow for a more active role for government actors in setting and meeting sustainability goals. This variation arises from the path-dependent qualities of institutions, which are influenced by historical, cultural, and political factors. (Source: Kuzemko et al., 2016, pp. 99, 102-103)"

            "answer": "The SDGs' achievement relies on ideas that offer political blueprints being compatible with dominant political values and supported by material conditions such as technology and wealth within a country's institutional context. This means that while transitions towards more sustainable practices may occur, they often coexist with stability and incremental policy changes to ensure compatibility and support from existing structures.

            "answer": "According to prior research (Werbeloff et al., 2016;  et al., 2016; 2022), the changing sustainability discourse puts pressure on domestic interests, potentially leading to reactive strategies or a gradual phase-out of fossil fuels. Simultaneously, institutional contexts remain stable due to their path-dependent nature. Policy outputs evolve through either new objectives and instruments being added or older instruments being applied to new objectives, resulting in path-dependent policy outcomes. It is assumed that most transition pathways towards sustainable development initially exhibit path-dependence or are shaped by established institutions, causing transition actors to make only minor adjustments in response to shifting global sustainability discourse.

            "answer": "Norway's oil production generates employment opportunities for the current generation, while all revenue from oil and gas production is paid into the sovereign wealth fund. The fund's investments provide income to sustain the welfare state for future generations and serve as a financial cushion during crises like COVID-19. Only the returns from these investments are used annually for infrastructure investments and maintaining the welfare state. (Source: [Borgen, 2021])"

            "answer": "The Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions (LO), which is the largest umbrella organization for trade unions in Norway and has held significant political influence due to its ties with the Labor Party, has traditionally supported the petroleum industry given its representation of many petroleum workers who are concerned about potential job losses (Houeland et al., 2020). However, in recent years, LO has been increasingly advocating for the concept of just transition in order to balance the interests of petroleum workers and those in the service and public sectors who are more focused on climate change concerns (Lund & Rønnow, 2021). This shift reflects LO's efforts to address the growing importance of environmental issues within its membership and the broader societal context."

            "answer": "The petroleum sector accounted for approximately 35% of Norway's exports in 2019, and related employment represented around 5.8% of the country's total employment (Statistics Norway, 2021b, p. 56). Despite this, Norway's petroleum exports have resulted in a high emissions embodiment per capita, making it one of the highest among the Nordic countries and even surpassing that of the United States (Sachs et al., 2022). The justification for the disconnect between petroleum policy and climate policy includes considerations of worker solidarity within the oil industry, universalism, and the need to maximize employment and welfare (2021, Houeland et al., 2020; Cox, 2004; 1989)."

By paying all state revenue from oil and gas into the fund to finance future generations' pensions, the government demonstrates a commitment to intergenerational solidarity and decommodification, freeing future generations from the market. Additionally, this practice aligns with the universalist welfare state model, which provides extensive welfare services and generous welfare benefits to all citizens. The tripartite regulation of the labor market and policymaking further reinforces these values. (Sources: Østergaard-Nielsen, 2021; Bjørnson & Hvinden, 2021a; Cox, 2004; Esping-Andersen, 1989.)"

This financial stability is necessary to support the extensive social programs in the country. However, there is a significant risk of a lock-in situation due to the immense wealth generated by the petroleum industry and the absence of technological advancements enabling the decoupling of environmental damage from economic activity.

            "answer": "The success of a country in achieving top performance on climate change-related SDGs depends on the alignment between the ideas underlying the SDGs and the political values embedded in the institutional context. Even if climate change is stated as a top priority, the continued development of industries like petroleum may hinder progress if there is a disconnect between political values and material conditions. This was evident after the 2021 parliamentary election, where smaller parties advocating for more ambitious disruptive approaches to climate change underperformed. Therefore, it is crucial for the political context and institutional values to support the implementation of SDGs related to climate change to avoid disruptive changes. (Based on the provided context from the Office of the Prime Minister, 2021)"

            "question": "What role do political values and material conditions play in determining a country's approach to addressing climate change through the SDGs?",
            "answer": "Political values and material conditions are significant factors in shaping a country's approach to addressing climate change through the SDGs. Ideas underlying the SDGs must align with the political values embedded in the institutional context and be supported by material conditions for a country to achieve top performance on the goals without a disruptive change. For instance, even if climate change is declared a top priority, the continued development of industries like petroleum can hinder progress if there is a disconnect between political values and material conditions. This was demonstrated during the 2021 parliamentary election when smaller parties advocating for more ambitious disruptive approaches to climate change underperformed.

            "answer": "In countries with high SDG scores, the values of solidarity and universalism can impact the implementation of destructive creation and inclusive development aspects of the SDGs. For instance, in Norway, political actors have successfully separated fossil fuel production from climate policy through direct and indirect references to institutionally embedded values of solidarity, universalism, and decommodification. This separation allows for the continuation of fossil fuel production while also prioritizing inclusive development and addressing climate change. However, the extent to which these values are prioritized can vary depending on the specific institutional context of each country. Overall, the case study demonstrates how the compatibility of destructive creation and inclusive development with values of solidarity and universalism can facilitate sustainable development goals in practice."
